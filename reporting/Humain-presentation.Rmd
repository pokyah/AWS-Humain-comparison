# Context & objectives <i class="fa fa-file"></i>

## Integration of the RMI + Pameseb AWS networks

* Agromet : providing hourly gridded (1km²) weather datasets for agricultural decision support system  
* Possibility of RMI stations integration for better spatialization ==> interoperability ?   

## Assessing the agreement level between the 2 types of AWS

* previous [work](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wea.2158/pdf) by Geoff Jenkins described a comparison method based on regression model correlation study.
* as demonstrated by [Giavarina](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4470095/), correlation studies is not appropriate to study the differences.
* The alternative [Bland-Altman analysis](https://www-users.york.ac.uk/~mb55/meas/ba.pdf) proposed by the authors is used in this study.

# First insights

## Similarity

Datasets seem in accordance ...

* but to which extent ? 
* How can we quantify this degree of similarity ?  
* Even if a certain degree of similarity : Pameseb seems warmer

## Temperature difference investigation

What can be infered by studying the temperature differences rather than their correlation ?

# Investigating the temperature difference

## Bland-Altman analysis

We can use a [Bland Altman analysis](https://pokyah.github.io/howto/assessing-the-agreement-between-2-quantitative-methods-of-measurements-understanding-the-Bland-Altman-analysis/) to measure the agreement level between the 2 stations.

It consists to take observations pair by pair, and plot their means vs. their differences.

In our case we choose to plot `IRM - Pameseb`.

## Vizualizing Bland-Altman analyis

```{r Plot of mean tsa vs. tsaPameseb - tsaIRM}
no_extra_filter$blandAltman$bland_altman.plot
```

## What the Bland-Altman plot tells us ?

* For most individuals, measurements made by 2 stations are more likely to be far apart between [`r signif(no_extra_filter$blandAltman$bland_altman.stats.df[1,2], 2)` ; `r signif(no_extra_filter$blandAltman$bland_altman.stats.df[1,4], 2)`] °C.

* 0 is not in the 95% CI of the mean difference [`r signif(no_extra_filter$blandAltman$bland_altman.stats.df[2,6], 2)` ; `r signif(no_extra_filter$blandAltman$bland_altman.stats.df[4,6], 2)` ] ==> It exists a systematic positif __bias__ of `r signif(no_extra_filter$blandAltman$bland_altman.stats.df[1,3],2)` (RMI globally warmer !)

* The scatter presents a trend going from positive bias to negative bias ==> proportional bias. The methods do not agree equally through the range of measurements.

* below 10 °C, IRM tends to be warmer (T°diff fluctuates above 0) and above 10°C, Pameseb tends to be warmer (T°diff flucutuates below0)


## a potential suspect : station design

The 2 stations are actually different in their design. While the __RMI__ is equipped with a Stevenson radiation screeen mechanically ventiled, __Pameseb__ is equipped with a custom screen without mechanical ventilation

![](./assets/shelters.png){ width=50% }

# Questioning the potential effect of the ventilation

## Hypothesis 1 

> the lack of ventilation system at Pameseb does not allow to sufficiently compensate the effect of direct solar radiation, leading to an overheating of the Pameseb shelter compared to RMI during situations of high irradiance and low wind.

If `TRUE`, the negative differences should be less pronounced during periods of __low irradiance (night) and high windspeed__. 

Lets apply the `filter_1` to our dataset : `vvt > q75(vvt) && ens == 0`

## Filter_1 :  BA Plot
```{r}
low_rad_high_wind$blandAltman$bland_altman.plot
```

## What the Filter 1 BA plot tells us ?

* For most individuals, measurements made by 2 stations are more likely to be far apart between [`r signif(low_rad_high_wind$blandAltman$bland_altman.stats.df[1,2], 2)` ; `r signif(low_rad_high_wind$blandAltman$bland_altman.stats.df[1,4], 2)`] °C.

* 0 is not in the 95% CI of the mean difference [`r signif(low_rad_high_wind$blandAltman$bland_altman.stats.df[2,6], 2)` ; `r signif(low_rad_high_wind$blandAltman$bland_altman.stats.df[4,6], 2)` ] ==> It exists a systematic positif __bias__ of `r signif(low_rad_high_wind$blandAltman$bland_altman.stats.df[1,3],2)` 

* The scatter still presents a trend going from positive bias to negative bias.

## Filter_1 & tsa > 10°C : BA Plot
```{r}
low_rad_high_wind_up10$blandAltman$bland_altman.plot
```

## What the Filter_1 & tsa > 10°C BA plot tells us ?

* For most individuals, measurements made by 2 stations are more likely to be far apart between [`r signif(low_rad_high_wind$blandAltman$bland_altman.stats.df[1,2], 2)` ; `r signif(low_rad_high_wind$blandAltman$bland_altman.stats.df[1,4], 2)`] °C.

* 0 is not in the 95% CI of the mean difference [`r signif(low_rad_high_wind$blandAltman$bland_altman.stats.df[2,6], 2)` ; `r signif(low_rad_high_wind$blandAltman$bland_altman.stats.df[4,6], 2)` ] ==> It exists a systematic positif __bias__ of `r signif(low_rad_high_wind$blandAltman$bland_altman.stats.df[1,3],2)` 

* The scatter still presents a trend going from positive bias to negative bias.

## Hypothesis 2 

> at night, the ventilation system does not sufficently compensate the much important warming effect of the radiation transfer of the wood shelter towards the sensor (compared to the less important one of the smaller plastic Pameseb shelter), leading to an overheating of the RMI sensor.

If `TRUE`, the positive differences should be less pronounced during periods __of high irradiance and high windspeed__. 

Lets apply the `filter_2` to our dataset : `vvt > q75(vvt) && ens >= mean(ens)`

## Filter_2 :  BA Plot
```{r}
high_rad_high_wind$blandAltman$bland_altman.plot
```

## What the Filter_2 BA plot tells us ?

* For most individuals, measurements made by 2 stations are more likely to be far apart between [`r signif(high_rad_high_wind$blandAltman$bland_altman.stats.df[1,2], 2)` ; `r signif(high_rad_high_wind$blandAltman$bland_altman.stats.df[1,4], 2)`] °C.

* 0 is not in the 95% CI of the mean difference [`r signif(high_rad_high_wind$blandAltman$bland_altman.stats.df[2,6], 2)` ; `r signif(high_rad_high_wind$blandAltman$bland_altman.stats.df[4,6], 2)` ] ==> It exists a systematic positif __bias__ of `r signif(high_rad_high_wind$blandAltman$bland_altman.stats.df[1,3],2)` 

* The scatter still presents a trend going from positive bias to negative bias.

## Filter_2 && tsa < 10°C :  BA Plot
```{r}
high_rad_high_wind_below10$blandAltman$bland_altman.plot
```


## What the High irradiance and low wind BA plot tells us ?

* The highest temperature discrepencies are 
* Learn outputs of BA stats

==> __prior to the integration of the 2 networks in the spatialization process, a correction model needs to be applied to the temperature data produced by the CRA-W AWS ne2rk__.

## Summarizing the examination of the potential effect of ventiliation

* IRM temperature tends to be higher when low temperature situations (<5°C) whatever the wind and irradiance conditions.
* Pameseb temperature tends to be higher when high temperature situations () only during low wind and high irradiance situations (lack of mechanical ventilation)
* more more ! Pay attention to axis, etc !!! A lot to say

# Solving the disagreement

## Strategy

We can build a temperature correction model based on irradiance and wind speed conditions


# Conclusions, perspectives and colofon

## Conclusions

* prior to spatialization, a correction model needs to be applied before integrating the 2 networks

## Perspectives
* Once finished, we plan to submit this work to the ["Weather" Journal of the RMETS](http://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/hub/journal/10.1002/(ISSN)1477-8696/aims-and-scope/read-full-aims-and-scope.html).
* title idea : 
  > Quantitative intercomparison of 2 years hourly records of temperature and relative
    humidity measured by 2 different types of professional-grade automatic weather stations
    at Humain, Belgium
